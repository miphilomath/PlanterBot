**Designing (Hardware)**

* [x] Make chasis (Currently the chasis is temporary made of cardboard which is meant to be replaced by more sturdy chasis.)
* [x] Attach Motor clamps for fixing motor and wheels.
* [x] Balance bot using caster ball on front.
* [x] Make multilevel attachments
* [x] Solder Resistor circuit to motor driver circuit.
* [x] Attach a power Button for Battery and Motor connection to power up the bot motors at will even with batteries connected.
* [x] Attach battery charging port on bot.
* [x] Solder resistors to RGB LED.
* [ ] Attach RGB LED on bot.
* [ ] Attach Camera neck on the bot for Picam to be fixed on.
* [ ] Fix camera on the bot.
* [ ] Attach a white LED along with PiCam to illuminate the path which turns on as soon as the script starts executing.
* [ ] Button to power up the rpi at will
* [x] Reducing and Simplify the design
* [x] Make a maintainable design

**Programming (Software)**

1 [ ] GPIO configuration
2 Follow Flowchart (to be updated)
3 [ ] Overlay
4 [ ] RGB Configration and blinking.
5 [ ] Track detection
6 [ ] Planter zone detection
7 [ ] Color Marker Detection
8 [ ] Inverted Plains detection
9 [ ] Motor Wheels control.
10 [ ] 

**Interfacing**
* [ ] Interface the hardware and software configurations, hardware gpio to the bot wheels on software execution.


Tasks Assigned:
--------------------
**Mohit**
* [ ] Overlaying flower image on the plantation field.

**Jaskirat**
* [ ] Detecting Color markers.

*Note*: Use Docker to develop to optimise the code on rpi and laptop both :)
