This is yet another incomplete project which I plan to complete this month.

### Program Structure
So the plan is simple, get the shit done! What needs to be done? Let's list them first.

Read the image file from the camera, find the path and move along.
Stop at certain checkpoints and blink the led.
Later add the voice compatibility.

### License
I don't care what you did with the code as long as you hold the responsibility of your action and don't hold me responsible for any actions.
